# CLI TODO  LIST

# Description
A command line application for managing your every day todos. It is stateful, using SQLite to store the data. 

# motivation
I was getting bored of using the Todoist, and I was itching for a project that would let me stretch my Rust muscles. This todo application was a great fit, as it was simple but it is easily extended. 

I knew I could write the todo list functionality, but this also allowed me to explore interacting with a database, using external crates, and Rust's crazy type system. Although it was a fairly straightforward project, got me a lot more comfortable in the language.

# Roadmap
I am working on adding a folder system right now. That way, I can keep school, work, and personal lists separate. I am also planning on adding a recurring todo item type, so I won't have to always add the same todo all the time.
